# ProBending

My largest project to date. Took 8 months to get to this stage. This was my capstone project at school. I created
a game in the likeness of Avatar: The Last Airbender (technically closer to The Legend of Korra, but same idea).

Designed my own game engine utilizing Kinect V2, SAPI, PhysX, Ogre3D, Cuda, OpenGL, and Rapid XML. 1 V 1 tournament
style gameplay where you control the elements of Earth, Fire, or Water in an effort to push your opponent off the
arena stage. 

I created a particle engine from scratch for the effects, and created a wrapper around the Kinect Library at a time
when there were no tutorials and the documentation was not yet complete (and the NUI library wasn't released yet). 

Some of the code started getting out of hand as I got closer to the deadline and a lot of other projects were coming due,
but in terms of the game itself, everyone who tried it at the CBC Convention Center enjoyed themselves.
